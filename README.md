# Campus Delivery Service

## Introduction
A controlled campus delivery service is offered on university campuses which allows students to order food and earn money as delivery drivers. We are implementing a rating system that tracks ratings for delivery drivers and restaurants. The rating system stores information about individual drivers and restaurants along with their ratings.

## Use Case For Rating System

## Business Rules
* Faculty and students may choose to not provide a rating 
* Only students can be drivers and must be approved
* Database will store the drivers license number, datehired, vehicle information, and ratings
* All deliveries are tied to one person and one restaurant
* One person may order one or many times and therefore can rate many times
* Restaurants must be approved and will provide an ID, location, schedule, website, and other attributes
